# typescript-react-redux-scaffold
This is an ongoing project to create a setup that I can use for building **React + Typescript + Redux** applications. 
As it is a learning experience for me, I would like to discourage people from trying to join me on the effort of developing it.

On the other hand, I appreciate any and all suggestions, complaints and bug reports that you guys can provide.

## Motivation
Thus far all current builds I have found fail to completely satisfy me in one of these topics:

1. No **Babel + Typescript** support.
2. They support **flux**, I want **redux**.
3. They don't offer support for **Mocha/Chai + Enzyme**
4. They don't blend into my particular workflow (*I accept being completely biased here*).

Additionally, developing this starter pack is allowing me to learn quite a few topics reggarding **Node.js, Webpack, TypeScript** and
several build tools.

## Features

* Develop **React** Applications.
* Develop **Redux** Applications.
* Use **TypeScript** for type checking.
* Use **ES6** and above features and compile everything using **Babel**.
* Run a **development server** that auto updates on changing my files, so I don't have to restart it.
* Run **linting** on all my files to maintain style.

Additionally:

* Develop my project **locally.**
* Develop my project using **Cloud9.**

## Planned Features
***Author's note:*** *I will be striking off features in this section as soon as they get added into the actual features section,
I'm doing this as an opportunity for me to track my own progress, in the future this section will be moved to **PROGRESS.MD***

As a developer I want to:

- [x] Develop **React** Applications.
- [x] Develop **Redux** Applications.
- [x] Use **TypeScript** for type checking.
- [x] Use **ES6** and above features and compile everything using **Babel**.
- [x] Run a **development server** that auto updates on changing my files, so I don't have to restart it.
- [x] Run **linting** on all my files to maintain style.
- [ ] Test my components using **Mocha/Chai + Enzyme**.
- [ ] Have a **pre-push** script that checks for my linting and testing to be correct.
- [ ] Have a **pre-commit** script that checks for my linting to be correct.
- [ ] Run **code coverage** to maintain my code quality.
- [ ] Create a **production build** that I can deploy.

I also want to:

- [x] Develop my project **locally.**
- [x] Develop my project using **Cloud9.**
- [ ] Develop my project using **CodeAnywhere.**


## Install ##

From your terminal run:

```bash
    git clone git@github.com:orlando-paredes-hamsho/typescript-react-redux-scaffold.git
```

Then once it's downloaded

```bash
    npm install
```

## Run the dev server ##

From your terminal run:

```bash
    npm run start 
```

Or in cloud 9:

```bash
    npm run cloud
```

Or in codeanywhere: (Can someone please confirm this, this platform hates me so far)

```bash
    npm run code
```

## Contribute
As I mentioned, this is a learning experience for myself, for this reason I would like to discourage all contributions until *at least*
version 1.0.0. rolls around. 

At that point, I will encourage anybody trying to do their first contribution to open-source to give it a go.

**Current version:** 0.1.*

**When will you update to 1.0.0?** When the original *planned feature* list has been completed.

*I do, however, encourage people to send me **suggestions for the Feature List** as well as **report bugs** to me on this repository.*

You may also find me on Twitter as **@orliph.**
